## Introducing Projects

Present all your projects in style with a super customizable web app! ‚ú®



## Inspiration

Needed a way to display all my projects, used my [portfolio's project section](https://lakshyadeepgogoi.netlify.app/#home) as inspiration.

## Getting Projects


The site should be live on `https://<your-username>.github.io/projects` or `lakshyadeep.netlify.app`




## Viewing projects

Open `index.html` in your favorite browser or visit [lakshyadeep.netlify.app](https://lakshyadeepgogoi.netlify.app/#home).

## How it was built

Projects was built using `HTML` `CSS` & `JavaScript`.
It will be updated soon.
Later I use Tailwind CSS and Reactjs Framework


## What I learned

- Learned about Web-Development, especially implementation of `Knowldege`.
- Flex, box-shadow and some other CSS tricks were revisited.
